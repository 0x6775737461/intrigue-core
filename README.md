# Welcome!

Intrigue Core is the open Attack Surface Mapping Engine. It discovers security-relevant assets and exposures for a given organization and can be used with a human-in-the-loop running individual tasks, and/or easily automated through the use of workflows. With a flexible entity model and an incredibly deep enrichment system, it is the most full-featured open source project its kind.

If you'd like assistance getting started or have development-related questions, feel free to join us in our [Intrigue Community slack](https://join.slack.com/t/intrigue-community/shared_invite/zt-gh42ghi8-P~Z6wf1Bj5097vLLuqen6g) channel.

# Getting Started... for Users

To get started quickly and play around with an instance of Core, head on over to the [Getting Started Guide](https://core.intrigue.io/getting-started/). We suggest the Docker image as a first place to start. It's actively built on the main branch of Intrigue Core. An image build on our unstable branch (develop) is also available if you're interested in testing the latest and greatest.

# Getting Started... for Developers

To get started setting up a development environment, follow the instructions below:

While you can build a local setup on any OSX or \*nix system, we'd suggest starting with our Vagrant setup guide: http://core.intrigue.io/getting-started-with-intrigue-core-on-vagrant-virtualbox/
